### Synopsis 

The aim of this project is a Calendar app for Android.

We are making a multi-purpose app made for organizing schedules, and also including an account book feature for financial purposes.

### Description

Our calendar will show this month, and you can choose to go to the next month or go back to the month before. each date will be set as a button, which you can press to put in information about how much money you spent that day. Also, an optional feature would be a window at the bottom of the screen to show the average amount of money spent on an everyday basis and show the total amout of money spent that month. we will also color and make sure that the layout is pleasing to see.
