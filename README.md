### Synopsis 

The aim of this project is a Calendar app for Android.

We are making a multi-purpose app made for organizing schedules, and also including an account book feature for financial purposes.

### Description

1. Basic layout
    * You can view today's date right after you open the application.
    * A monthly calendar showing this month is located below today's date.
    * The panel that shows "today" will be highlighted in a different color.
2. Goals
    * We focused on making sure that people using this calendar would    
    be able to easily check today's dates and stay organized.

### Background

For this Android application school project, we used Java which is widely used by people all around the world for creating applications
(We are taking a Java course this semester).
